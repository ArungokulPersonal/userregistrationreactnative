API Integration
The module integrates with backend APIs to handle user registration and login.

Endpoint: /req/login
Method: GET
Parameters:
email: User's username
password: User's password

Registration API:

Endpoint: /req/signup
Method: POST
Parameters:
username: User's desired username
email: User's email
password: User's password

API Service (auth.js)
javascript


Screens
LoginScreen.js

Contains form fields for email and password.
Calls authService.login on form submission.
RegisterScreen.js

Contains form fields for username, email, and password.
Calls authService.register on form submission.
WelcomeScreen.js

Displays a welcome message to the user upon successful login.

Troubleshooting
Ensure the API base URL is correct in util/auth.js.
Test the backend API endpoints independently to confirm they’re working.
Use React Native Debugger for inspecting network requests and errors.
